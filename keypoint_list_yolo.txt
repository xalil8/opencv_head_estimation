Each keypoint represents a specific joint in the body, and the model outputs the coordinates and confidence scores for each joint. 
By connecting the keypoints, it is possible to obtain a skeleton representation of the person, which can be used for further analysis
 and applications such as action recognition, human-computer interaction, and fitness tracking.
